## Asynchronous Parallel Gradient Boosting using Parameter Server

\section{Summary}
We plan on implementing a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm in an asynchronous framework. We are going to distribute the work in parallel through a parameter server, whilst first creating a proof of concept in OpenMP and MPI. Performance will be compared with sequential and parallel implementation in OpenCV and XGBoost.
